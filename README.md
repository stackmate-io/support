## What is Stackmate.io
Stackmate.io is the easiest way to deploy web applications to **your** AWS accounts. All you have to do is provide a GitHub repository, and we take it from there: deploy your AWS instances, SSL certificates, RDS databases, Elasticache clusters, Data volumes, S3 buckets, Cloudfront distributions and more! We also take care of your configurations for nginx, puma, gunicorn for you and provide an easy way to manage those per environment.

## What Stackmate.io is not
We're not a hosting company. We're merely a provisioning tool that helps you launch your AWS resources, on AWS accounts that you provide and manage. Every resource deployed by Stackmate.io, whether it's servers, databases, storage or content distribution networks, is directly accessible via your AWS console. We just make sure your apps get deployed to a secure and reliable AWS setup.

## Getting started
To get started with Stackmate.io, visit our website at https://stackmate.io and log in with your GitHub account. You will then be able to add AWS accounts and deploy your projects to the cloud. You can read more about how Stackmate.io works at [docs.stackmate.io](https://docs.stackmate.io)

## Why Stackmate.io
Stackmate is the perfect solution for the busy professional. We work hard to abstract any complexity and make sure you can deploy your applications to the cloud as fast and efficiently as it gets. Just add a repository to Stackmate.io and you'll be up and running in just a few minutes.
